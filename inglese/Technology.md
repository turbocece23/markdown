# Technology

## <span style="color:#5555ff">Definition</span>
It is the application of knowledge to the practical aims of human life.

## <span style="color:#5555ff">Applications</span>
We apply technology in almost everything we do in our lives, we use technology at work, we use it to extract materials, we use technology for communication, transportation, learning, manufacturing, creating artifacts, securing data and so much more.

## <span style="color:#5555ff">Difference between technology and science</span>
**SCIENCE** is concerned with **HOW and WHY things happen**.

**TECHNOLOGY** focuses on **MAKING THINGS HAPPEN**.

Technology is also an application of science to solve a problem.

As humans, we use both technology and science together, that is why we confuse these two to be the same. Science deals with the knowledge of the natural world whereas technology refers to the human-made world determined by processing, development and management.

## <span style="color:#5555ff">What can technology do for us</span>
Technology is one of the main ways we change the world. Whether it’s a complex technology like the internet, or simple technology like the wheel, one of the basic elements of human civilization is that we use technology.

But it’s not a one-way street. The moment a new technology was born, it also has an effect on us. **Our lives change as a result of our technologies**. Technology may help us stay more connected with the people we love, but it also enables us to stay more connected with our work.

It’s not so much a question of whether we govern our technology or our technology governs us; it’s more a recognition that **our relationship with technology and with other human beings** and the planet through technology, **is complicated**.

## <span style="color:#5555ff">Different types of technology</span>

We use technology to accomplish various tasks, so technology comes in different types: information technology, communication technology, bio-related and agriculture technology, medical, environmental, manufacturing and construction, transportation, energy and power, nanotechnology. 

- Construction technology
	- It's the study of advanced methods and equipments which can be used to build structures such as buildings or heavy engineering structures. The use of construction technological tools like heavy tractors to prepare land where the construction will be, computer design software to create design for structures on computers in 3D format
- Medical technology
	- It reduces the patient's pain and injury. Developed countries have benefited from the use of medical technology in their health care systems and this explains the reason why people in developed countries live longer than people in developing countries.	
- Environmental technology
	- Is the application of one or more of envoironmental science, green chemistry, envoironmental montirng and electronic devices to monitor, model and conserve the natural environment. The term i also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics, wind turbines, bioreactors...
- Information technology
	- Is a set of hardware and software tools used to store information. Information technology tools help in providing the right people with the right information with the right time.
- Communication technology
	- It's a system that uses technical means to transmit information or data from one place to another or from one person to another. It is used to convey ideas, exchange information and express emotions. We use technology to facilitate the flow of information in a workplace, help in decision making and promote new products or services.
- Entertainment technology
	- This is a process of using various technological components to create an entertainment experience. Since enternainment is too borad, every one gets entertained in their own way. Technology is used to build thetres, it is used to create video games, to dvelop musical systems and so much more. Entertainment technology includes things like video, sound, automation. Animation, scenery fabrication, computer simulations. Interactive envoironments and so much more
